# Welcome to Size Your Drive


## Application Purpose
This Application is designed for individuals or entities organizing a clothing drive. This application logs what items you are planning on donating and sends an email with a PDF attachment of your donation items to whomever is organizing the clothing drive. This application helps the organization receiving the donations save time sorting through the clothing by getting an itemized donation box pdf. Furthermore, it also holds the people donating accountable by not allowing them to donate unusable items. In addition, Some charities are needing specific clothing so this will allow the organizer to know where they need to send the clothing.
